SKSurrogate
==================
``SKSurrogate`` is a suite of tools which implements surrogate optimization for expensive
functions based on ``scikit-learn``. The main purpose of ``SKSurrogate`` is to facilitate
hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models and optimized pipeline design (AutoML).

The version of the surrogate optimization implemented here heavily relies on regressors.
A custome regressor based on Hilbert Space techniques is implemented, but all ``scikit-learn``
regressors are accepted for optimization.

Finding an optimized pipeline -based on a given list of transformers and estimators- is
a time consuming task. A version of evolutionary optimization has ben implemented to reduce
tis time in lieu of global optimality.

Dependencies
----------------
``SKSurrogate`` heavily depends on `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_,
`scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_, and `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_,
for its main functionalities. Other dependencies include `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_,
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_, `SALib <https://github.com/SALib/SALib>`_,
`peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_, and
`tqdm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`_.

Documentation
----------------
The documentation is produced by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ and is intended to cover code usage
as well as a bit of theory to explain each method briefly.
